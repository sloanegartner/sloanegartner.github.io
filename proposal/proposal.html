	<h1>Project Proposal</h1>

<section>
	<p>There are over 6,000 breweries and 8,000 wineries in the United States. The culture that surrounds drinking is large and continues to grow  with every new drink discorvered. Whether that be a new beer, wine, or mixed drink it is hard to deny the excitment people feel from trying a new drink and the curiosity they seek to find another. Specifically, in Harrisonburg, Virgina and Rockingham County, there are multiple local breweies and wineries that manufacture and sell their own brand. These are then sold in stores and resturants, but locals may not know about the drink enough to buy it. I would like to create a website that will be able to locate brewies and wineries near the user. Once found, the user will be able to look at the local beers and wines and get a brief background of what is sold in that area. I would base the websites information on Harrisonburgs breweries and wineries since that is the demographic and audience my website is trying to reach; locals and young adults. 
	</p>

	<p>One persona would be a young adult who has an occasional drink with friends after work. She's tried to expand out from her usual drink of choice, but the last couple times she has, they haven't been her favorite. She doesn't want to take a chance and spend money on something she'll end up not liking. She also is tired of the same wine and has the goal to expand her pallet. The website would be able to serve as a serach engine for those wanting to learn more about the drinks in their area as well as the drinks they could possibly enjoy.</p>

	<p>The information would be based off of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County. The informaiton provided would be similar to <a href="https://untappd.com/v/pour-and-connect/9756269" target="_blank">Pour and Connects</a> beer options and the wine options from local <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=wineries&find_loc=Harrisonburg%2C+VA" target="_blank">wineries.</a> It would consist of the name of the drink, where it is brewed, ingredients, and average price.</p>

	<p>For layout, I plan to have my homepage be a single page, no scroll, with the option of "Beer", "Wine", and "More". The beer and wine section would contain information on the local "Beer" and "Wine" in the area as well as the ingredients, price, etc. The structure would be a grid style layout. In the "More" section, it would showcase the local breweries and wineries in the area as well as local areas to socialize. This would be more of a scroll page. </p>

	<img class="displayed" src="img3.png" alt="grid" width="375" height="275"></center>

	<p>I plan to work on the home page and the "More" page through the week of 4/13-4/17 and the "Beer" and "Wine" page through 4/20-4/24. I then plan to editing and finalize the website through 4/27-4/30.</p>
