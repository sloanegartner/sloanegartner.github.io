	<h1>Project Proposal</h1>

<section>
	<p>Harrisonburg Virgina is home to many local breweries and wineries that then sell their product to locals. The websites, however, that showcase these businesses do not appeal to the demographic that purchase their drinks. I would like to redesign Harrisonburg's <a href="https://www.visitharrisonburgva.com/breweries/ " target="_blank"> Brewery </a> page and add a wineries page as well. In addition to the Brewery page and Wine page, I would like to add a "More" page which would feature some of the local beer sold in the area. I would get the information on the wine from Harrisonburrg's local <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=wineries&find_loc=Harrisonburg%2C+VA" target="_blank">wineries</a> and redesign Pour and Connects <a href="https://untappd.com/v/pour-and-connect/9756269" target="_blank">beer</a> page. It would consist of the name of the drink, where it is brewed, ingredients, and average price.</p>

	<p>One persona would be a young adult or student, who has an occasional drink with friends after work. She's tried to expand out from her usual drink of choice, but the last couple times she has, they haven't been her favorite. She doesn't want to take a chance and spend money on something she'll end up not liking. She also is tired of the same wine and has the goal to expand her pallet. The website would be able to serve as a better search engine for locals to use in the Harrisonburg community. This would allow for the local breweries to gain new customers as well as business since the site would appeal to their main audience.</p>

	<p>For layout, I plan to have my homepage be a single page, no scroll, with the option of "Brewery", "Wineries", and "More". The beer and wine section would contain information on the local breweries and wineries in the area as well as the ingredients, price, etc. The structure would be a grid style layout. In the "More" section, it would showcase the local beers sold in the area as well as local areas to socialize. This would be more of a scroll page. </p>

	<img class="displayed" src="img3.png" alt="grid" width="375" height="275"></center>

	<p>I plan to work on the home page and the "More" page through the week of 4/13-4/17 and the "Brewery" and "Wineries" page through 4/20-4/24. I then plan to editing and finalize the website through 4/27-4/30.</p>
