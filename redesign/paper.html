    <h1> Written Synopsis</h1>
    <p>I chose to work on the local Breweries and Wineries in Harrisonburg and Rockingham County are because I felt that the audience for that type of website was relativily large. With Harrisonburg being a college town, the interest for weekend activities and socializing is popular. At first I had trouble with this project. I didn't understand what Boostrap was exactly. I, at first, that it was another source code editor, then I thought is was some sort of desktop app I had to download. It wasn't until the Linkdein videos where I realized that it was a source of codes that had to be linked to the html page. The Linkdein videos, along with Boostrap videos and Youtube, helped me get the full understanding of Bootsrap and the grid structure. Once I understood what I could do with Bootstrap, I made a plan on how I was going to make each page. I wanted sepertate pages, not a scroll, because I wanted the content to have it's own identity. I made the Home page just the Jumbotron and footer with a button to an About page, that would just contain written content. The Breweries and Wineries page, I wanted to be scroll with links to the actual places. The Drinks page, I used the grid structure, which made it all look very uniformed. Lastly, the Contact page I made a form.</p>

    <p>As for the design, I took the picture presented on the Home page and I made the black icons in the header of each page. I wanted the website to have a dark, night, wooden feel. I looked at websites with similar content and they all were dark, dim, and had a dark rustic feel to them. I called it the AleHouse becasue the website contains information on many different drinks in the area. The font coloring is dark gold to match with the main picture and pop while on the black and next to the white. I made the color of the links turn to, once hovered, a darker gold. The images presented on the Breweries, Wineries, and Drinks pages are the logos of the places or beer. The background, I chose because it is a light black and I liked the wood panelling.</p>

    <p>The content is from <a href="https://www.visitharrisonburgva.com/breweries/" target="_blank" style="font-size: 1em"> Harrisonburg's Travel site</a>. The Footer information contains the site's tagline "Friendly By Nature", their email and phone number, and a dropdown menu displaying their social media.</p>

    <p>The html pages of my site are, Home page(index.html), About page(about.html), Breweries(breweries.html), Wineries(wineries.html), Drinks(drinks.html), and Contact(contact.html). Each are linked to a customed CSS file and they all contain a header, navigation, sections, and a footer. The navigation is responsive with nav-items becoming vertical as the screen becomes small. On the Drinks page, the columns are responsive by showing 3 to 1 as the screen becomes smaller. The Footer also becomes stacked as the screen becomes smaller. The content on each page is relevant and each page contains original work. Any image that is not mine as a link to where I got it.</p>

    <p>On each page there are buttons and links that open to a new tab. The Breweries page has buttons "What's On Tap" that open to the breweries. The Wineries page has "Another Glass" that opens to the wineries. There is a navbar on each page and a Jumbotron on the Home page with a link to an about page.</p>

    <p>I added a dropdown menu in the Footer that presents all the social media(4) and I added two Bootstrap icons. They both are in the Footer next to the email and phone number. There is also one on the contact page.</p>
